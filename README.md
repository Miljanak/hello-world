Hello World - Revised  
## Assignment 2   
I have chosen Python program because it started to be the most used language in programming. The second reason why I picked it is because it is recommended by the teacher. In the future as IT graduate I will have to know it and will be plus for me having knowledge in this program. IDE that I have chosen is Thonny since this one support Python program.
